    is the file's geometry, as ``build123d.import_step`` would read it — the
    root itself, not a wrapper — with per-occurrence and prototype STEP colors

    read as data announces nothing, so a model built from a vendor STEP went on
    reporting itself current after that STEP was replaced, and the only way to

    the file: its path and content hash join the model's closure, and the next
    run's gate re-hashes it (design/dxf-build123d.md).

    A missing file raises here rather than deep inside the importer, because
    "the vendor STEP is not where the model thinks it is" is the whole message.
